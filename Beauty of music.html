Beauty is an object, person, or an idea that creates a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction. Beauty is found in many everyday things such as nature, art, literature, and music. The most beautiful of all of these is music. Music is beautiful in a way that nothing else can be. Music is beautiful because it makes the listener have pleasure and satisfaction while listening to it, but it also leaves the composer with pleasure and satisfaction from writing it. Some ways that music is beautiful are that the listener can relate to the lyrics, the composer can express their feelings through the lyrics, and a song can tell a story.

Music has been a way for people to express their feelings and tell a story for thousands of years. One genre of music that holds this to be true is rap. Rap is common for being a way of expressing ones feelings through song. Not only does rap express one's feelings but it is also known for a way of rappers to tell either the story of their life or the story of the lifestyle from where they grew up. Rap proves music is beautiful because of the satisfaction and pleasure it gives to the composer and nothing is more beautiful then someone being satisfied.
