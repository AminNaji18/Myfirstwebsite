Life is full of contrasts. Some are amazing, like how some places are covered in snow while others only know heat. Some are awe-inspiring, like how blue whales weigh as much as 30 tons yet they can propel themselves out of the water and jump some 45 to 50 feet in the air. While some are sad. Like how some children have never stepped foot into a school, don’t know where their next meal will come from and probably have to work like adults. And all while their counterparts from other parts around the world get to attend school, eat well, goof around and generally live like kids. That, we believe is one of life’s saddest contrasts. Luckily, we can make it disappear.
At 4 Humanity, we believe that every child deserves to live like a child and that quality education is the right of every child. This is why we facilitate access to education for children and young people in countries that have plunged into deep crises because of wars.
And while we know, our goal is ambitious, we know we can’t do it without you. This is why we have created a marketplace that allows you to shop for any personal or household product you need, and at the best market prices. From jewelry to watches, home accessories and much more, we basically give you access to a wide range of items you need. Here comes the good part- all profits generated from the sale of the items are donated to helping our cause.
Now, imagine if every time you shopped you not only got to save  but also sent an underprivileged child like Jenny to school? 4 Humanity allows you to do just that.
Every child deserves a fair chance at life. Visit www.4humanity.de to shop today and help us spread the word to your friends.
